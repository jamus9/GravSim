# Gravity Simulation
A JavaFX application that simulates the movement of planets in two dimensions in realistic scale.

The movement is calculated in real time with the gravitational force betweeen all planets. When planets collide, they merge into a bigger one with the new adjusted momentum.

The user can load premade constellations and add planets directly to the scene. Orbits, Labels, Vectors and Inforamtion can be turned on in the settings menu.
