# Gravity Simulation
A JavaFX application that simulates the movement of planets in two dimensions in realistic scale.

The movement is calculated in real time with the gravitational force betweeen all planets. When planets collide, they merge into a bigger one with the new adjusted mass and momentum.

The user can load premade constellations like the Solar System and add planets directly to the scene. Orbits, labels, vectors and information can be turned on in the settings menu.
